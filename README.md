# EMF JavaScript training notes and demo app

This repo consist of two parts. The app itself, which demonstrates some modern tools for building full-stack JavaScript web applications, and a short JavaScript tutorial to run through the foundational material which is required to understand how to build the app.

## Demo app

The app will be using (at least)
* Express
* MongoDB
* Vue
* Gulp
* Browserify

Most of the app still needs to be built.

## JavaScript tutorial

* [Scope and closures](tutorial/closures.md)
* [Modules](tutorial/modules.md)
* [Objects and prototypes](tutorial/objects.md)
* Promises (coming soon)
